# Time-Series
Time Series Project for the course (Applied Mathematics and Computer Science)

### Description

#### Part 1 of the Report
The file QualidadeARO3.xlsx contains time series of hourly-ground-levels of O3 values, in micrograms
per cubic meter (µg/m3), collected at the following stations of the qualar network:
• Antas-Espinho
• Entrecampos
• Estarreja
• Laranjeiro-Almada
• Mem-Martins
• Paio-Pires
• Restelo
• Sobreiras-Porto
• VNTelha-Maia
from 01/01/2020 to 31/12/2020. Further details on the qualar network can be found in this link
https://qualar.apambiente.pt/.
1. Fit a SARIMA-type model to each of the nine time series. Discuss your model fitting in a
step-by-step fashion, presenting your
(a) initial examination of the data;
(b) transformations (if necessary);
(c) initial identification of the dependence orders;
(d) parameter estimation;
(e) residual diagnostics and model choice.
2. After deciding on appropriate models, forecast the data into the future up to 5 time periods
ahead and calculate 95% prediction intervals for each of the 5 forecasts.

#### Part 2 of the Report
The files:
• EDP RENOVAVEISprice.xlsx
• GALP ENERGIA-NOMprice.xlsx
• MOTA ENGILprice.xlsx
• NOSSGPSprice.xlsx
• NOVABASESGPSprice.xlsx
contain daily share related-prices from five companies (EDP, GALP, MOTA ENGIL and NOVABASESGPS) listed on Euronext Lisbon (https://live.euronext.com/pt/markets/lisbon), namely the date,
open, high, low, close, number of shares, number of trades, turnover and vwap.
1. For the five time series calculate its corresponding log-returns associated to the daily closing
values;
2. Fit the best GARCH-type model to the time series of log-returns. Discuss your model fitting in
a step-by-step fashion, presenting your
(a) initial examination of the data;
(b) initial identification of the dependence orders;
(c) parameter estimation;
(d) residual diagnostics and model choice.
